[{"Booknamn":"If I Never Forever Endeavor","Omdome":"this is a good and helpful book","Recension":"This book was about a bird who didn\u0027t yet know how to fly. The bird has to decide if it will try to fly, but it was not sure if it wants to. The bird thought, \u0022If I never forever endeavor\u0022 then I won\u0027t ever learn. I think this book would help other children to learn that trying new things can be scary, but sometimes when we try, we can find things that make us happy too.","Forfattarenamn":"Erik","Visaresult":"positiv review"},{"Booknamn":"Flesh \u0026 Blood So Cheap","Omdome":"the book is well writen. I like it. ","Recension":"Readers can gain knowledge of what it was like to work in New York City in the early 1900s. One of the things that was especially interesting was that there were no safety laws at work. Also, there was a big contrast between the rich and the poor. Some people may not like this book because it is very depressing, but it is an important event in history to remember.","Forfattarenamn":"Sama","Visaresult":"positiv review"},{"Booknamn":"About Marsupials","Omdome":"i do not like it. it waste your time.","Recension":"The glossary of facts in the back of About Marsupials is the most useful part. I thought the most interesting parts were that some marsupials have their pouch at their back legs and one marsupial, the Yellow-footed Rock Wallaby, is very small but can jump 13 feet wide! the book is not my type. it has few words on each page. it is for kids only.
